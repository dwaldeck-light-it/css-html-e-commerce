          TODO: Complete the HTML below to match the provided design.
          You need to include all products with their image, brand name, description, price, and a heart icon.
          Some image files are already available in 'public/img', but you will need to export the missing ones from Figma.
          
          Make sure to:
          - Use semantic HTML (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h2>, <p>) for better structure and accessibility.
          - Provide meaningful alt text for all images.
          - Ensure that text is readable and the layout is accessible (e.g., proper contrast, keyboard navigation).
          - Use aria-labels where appropriate (e.g., for the heart/favorite button).
          
          Keep your code clean, well-indented, and easy to read.
