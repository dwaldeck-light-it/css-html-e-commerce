# E-commerce Challenge Template

This repository contains a basic starter template for the **E-commerce Challenge**.

## What’s included

- A minimal HTML boilerplate (`index.html`) with a placeholder section for the product grid.
- Some product images already included in the `public/img` folder.
- Basic page structure and heading.

## Your task

Your goal is to **recreate the layout shown in the Figma design**. 

## Notes

- This is just a **template** — it does not include any final layout or styling.
- You are expected to write both the **HTML and CSS** from scratch.
- Use best practices for clean, maintainable code.

Good luck!
